    using clear property we can decide weather an element will appear below floated elements
    which precede it.
    Note: 1. this property can be used to floated elements as well.
          2. this property will work on block-level elements only, try using it on 
              inline elements and it wouldn't work.
          3. top-margin will completely collapse when used on non-floated elements.
              Note: when element is inline-block then top margin doesn't collapse.
              TODO: Need to understand this peculiar behaviour of inline-block.
          4. vertical margins remain intact when used on floated elements.
