  In addition to an accessible name, the label provides a larger 'hit' area
  for mouse and touch screen users to click on or touch. By pairing a <label>
  with an <input>, clicking on either one will focus the <input>. If you use
  plain text to "label" your input, this won't happen. Having the prompt part
  of the activation area for the input is helpful for people with motor control conditions.
  Note: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label
    this article explains a great deal about the relationship between <label /> and <input /> tags.
