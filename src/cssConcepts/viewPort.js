  of different elements like viewport, html etc etc
https://www.quirksmode.org/mobile/viewports.html#link10
  1. visual viewport 
  2. layout viewport

    this article shows a demo of real time simulation
    which shows the difference between visual and layout viewports

  Ques -> 1. is Initial Containing Block (ICB) is formed by the viewort only.
            as it contains <html /> tag just inside it.
            if not then what exactly is the ICB.
          2. is it possible to create ICB ourselves ??
    
    This was written on CSS Specifications
      For continuous media, it has the dimensions of the viewport and is anchored at the
      canvas origin; it is the page area for paged media.
      Now to understand this first i do need to understand what is the difference between 
      all of these medias.
